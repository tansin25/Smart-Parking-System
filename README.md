# Smart-Parking-System
A parking system using IOT and arduino
The projct uses IOT asbase technology along with Arduino UNO board where many proximity sensors are present which include Ultrasonic sensors and Infrared sensors.
At the entrance gate the LED displays the realtime updated data(code is present) recieved through IR sensors present at parking slots and when a car enters the lot
the Ultrasonic sensor detects the car and sends signal to servo motor to open the parking barricading (iff there is a free slot available else gate wont open).
As soon as gate opens the driver parks the car at the free slot and the data gets updated on the console as well as LED by its own.
